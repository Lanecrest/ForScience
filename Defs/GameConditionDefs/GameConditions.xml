<!-- This is the game condition def for the custom Solar Flare event, however this would only ever be seen if it was triggered via Dev Mode, as the included patch causes the vanilla Solar Flare to trigger this condition instead. In otherwords, anytime a regular Solar Flare would trigger, this behavior is executed instead.  -->
